# Modularity-and-Fermat-s-last-theorem
This repository is about my Master's thesis on Modularity and Fermat's last theorem under the supervision of Dr. Jeroen Hanselman. 
My master's thesis, titled "\textbf{Modularity Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem}," is an in-depth exploration of the intricate connections between elliptic curves, modular forms, and Fermat's Last Theorem, guided by the comprehensive text "A First Course in Modular Forms" by Diamond and Shurman. This was done under the expert supervision of Dr. Jeroen Hanselman and Prof. Claus Fieker. 

The core of my study involved a detailed examination of key topics, including elliptic curves, modular forms, congruence subgroups, Hecke operators, modular curves, Jacobians, and Abelian varieties. This foundational knowledge was further expanded by delving into curves in arbitrary characteristics, Eichler-Shimura relations, L-functions, and Galois representations. A pivotal part of my study included a thorough analysis of Ribet's seminal 1990 paper, which was instrumental in understanding Ribet's theorem and its implications for deducing Fermat's Last Theorem, assuming the validity of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (now known as the Modularity Theorem). 

Complementing this, I have also been exploring sections of the seminal paper by Andrew Wiles and James Taylor on Fermat's Last Theorem, a work that has always captivated me. The past few months have been incredibly enriching and challenging, particularly marked by my study of Diamond and Shurman's book. The book's approach, which leaves significant gaps in proofs and exercises for the reader to fill, required me to build a robust foundation in areas such as Modular Forms and Galois Representations, subjects I hadn't previously studied in depth. Understanding Wiles' Criterion was a moment of fulfillment, as it connected back to my longstanding aspiration to comprehend the proof of this groundbreaking theorem since I began my serious pursuit of mathematics.

An intriguing aspect of my thesis was the practical application of these theories. I chose a specific modular curve, $X_0(38)$, as a case study. This choice allowed me to theoretically explore and practically demonstrate various aspects of the theory, such as computing the genus, decomposing the Jacobian into Abelian varieties, and deriving the equation for this modular curve. These computations were performed both manually and with computer assistance.\\

One of my objectives was to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and its practical implementation. To this end, I extensively used the information available on the LMFDB page for $X_0(38)$ to mathematically demonstrate and compute some of the things, rather than merely relying on computational tools.
